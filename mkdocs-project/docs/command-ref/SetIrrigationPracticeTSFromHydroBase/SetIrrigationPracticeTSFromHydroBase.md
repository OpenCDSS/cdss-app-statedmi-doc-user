## Overview ##

**This command is obsolete - instead, use the
[`ReadIrrigationPracticeTSFromHydroBase`](../ReadIrrigationPracticeTSFromHydroBase/ReadIrrigationPracticeTSFromHydroBase.md) command.**

The older `SetIrrigationPracticeTSFromHydroBase` command (for StateMod)
was used for RGDSS Phase 4 RÃ­o Grande work, and only works with one year of parcel data (e.g., 1998).
However, an entirely new procedure has now been implemented, which can be applied to all basins.
The new procedure relies on processing water rights into a StateMod water rights file
and then using this file as input when processing parcels for the irrigation practice time series.
Other commands have also been implemented to allow more control over acreage processing.

If necessary, see the legacy Word documentation for information about the old command.
