## Overview ##

**This command is obsolete - instead, use the
[`SetIrrigationPracticeTSSprinklerAcreageFromList`](../SetIrrigationPracticeTSSprinklerAcreageFromList/SetIrrigationPracticeTSSprinklerAcreageFromList.md) commmand.**

The legacy `SetIrrigationPracticeTSSprinklerAreaFromList` command
was used for RGDSS Phase 4 RÃ­o Grande work.
However, an entirely new procedure has now been implemented, which can be applied to all basins.
The new procedure relies on processing water rights into a StateMod water rights file and then
uses this file as input when processing parcels for the irrigation practice time series.
Other commands have also been implemented to allow more control over acreage processing.
