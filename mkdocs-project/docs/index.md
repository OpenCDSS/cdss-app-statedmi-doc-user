# CDSS / StateDMI #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](http://cdss.state.co.us/Pages/CDSSHome.aspx) StateDMI software,
which automates processing data for StateCU and StateMod datasets.
StateDMI can also be used to implement general workflows that process State of Colorado HydroBase and other data.
This documentation is generally referred to as the **"User Documentation"** in contrast to
**"Developer Documentation"**, which is relevant to software developers.

## Colorado's Decision Support Systems ##

Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS, [cdss.state.co.us](http://cdss.state.co.us))
has been developed to answer important questions about Colorado's water resources.
CDSS efforts are led by the [Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB)](http://cwcb.state.co.us)
and [Colorado Division of Water Resources (DWR)](http://water.state.co.us).

CDSS has been under development since 1994, with progress occurring via a series of basin
decision support systems (DSS), starting with the Colorado River DSS (CRDSS).
Other focused DSS were also developed, such as the CWCB's Instream Flow DSS.
Each DSS resulted in enhancements to the core CDSS tools,
which are envisioned as a general platform of data and tools to help with water supply planning.

The StateDMI software was developed in CDSS to process data
from Colorado's HydroBase database into into StateCU and StateMod model data files.

In late 2016, the Open Water Foundation began the effort to move StateDMI and other CDSS software to open source licensing
and establish open source software projects, referred to as "OpenCDSS".
The OpenCDSS project is resulting in a significant evolution in how CDSS software development occurs,
such as implementing version control with Git/GitHub and modernizing the development environment and documentation.
See the [OpenCDSS Website](http://opencdss.state.co.us/opencdss/) for more information.

## About the Open Water Foundation ##

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise that focuses
on developing and supporting open source software for water resources,
so that organizations can make better decisions about water.
OWF also works to advance open data tools and implementation.
OWF staff have been the primary StateDMI developers on State of Colorado and other projects.
