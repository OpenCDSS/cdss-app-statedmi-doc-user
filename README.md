# cdss-app-statedmi-doc-user #

Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS) StateDMI software user documentation.

This repository is a placeholder.  Word/PDF documentation currently exists in the
[`cdss-app-statemod-main/doc`](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-app-statedmi-main/tree/master/doc) repository.

It is envisioned that documentation will be migrated to Markdown/MkDocs format.
